Analytical Study of Surfaced Enhanced Raman Scattering in Silver Pyridine Nanostructure compared to ordinary Silver Pyridine nanostructure using Lammps (Molecular Dynamics software). Molecular Dynamics Simulations were performed to compute the velocity auto correlation function for Silver icosahedra and then Silver icosahedra with pyridine molecule. Fourrier transformation was performed to obtain the corresponding vibrational density of states data. Finally used Matplotlib to plot the obtained VDOS results.This VDOS result gives us an analytical understanding of Surface enhancement in Raman Scattering between Silver icosahedra and Silver icosahedra with pyridine molecule. More details have been submitted in the papertalk file.
